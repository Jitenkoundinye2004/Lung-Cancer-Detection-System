AI-Powered Lung Cancer Detection from CT Scans
This web application leverages a deep learning model to analyze chest CT scans and predict the likelihood of common types of lung cancer. It provides a user-friendly interface for patients and healthcare professionals to upload scans, view results, and manage a history of diagnoses.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Users can register and log in to a secure account. Passwords are encrypted and validated for complexity.

CT Scan Upload & Analysis: A simple interface to upload patient details and a corresponding CT scan image.

AI-Powered Prediction: The backend processes the image through a sophisticated pipeline involving filtering, segmentation, and a VGG16-based deep learning model to classify the scan into one of four categories:

Adenocarcinoma

Large Cell Carcinoma

Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Normal (Healthy)

Detailed Results Page: Displays the prediction, confidence score, and the processed images (original, filtered, segmented).

Downloadable PDF Reports: Users can download a professional PDF report for each diagnosis, which includes patient details, results, and all associated images.

Organized Patient History:

A main history page lists all patients associated with the user's account.

Clicking on a patient shows a detailed, chronological view of all their past scans and results.

Interactive & Professional UI: The entire application is designed with a modern, clean, and responsive user interface for a professional, industry-level feel.

Contact Form: An integrated contact form that sends inquiries directly to the administrator's email.
