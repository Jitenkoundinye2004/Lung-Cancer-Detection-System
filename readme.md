AI-Powered Lung Cancer Detection from CT ScansThis web application leverages a deep learning model to analyze chest CT scans and predict the likelihood of common types of lung cancer. It provides a user-friendly interface for patients and healthcare professionals to upload scans, view results, and manage a history of diagnoses.‚ú® FeaturesSecure User Authentication: Users can register and log in to a secure account. Passwords are encrypted and validated for complexity.CT Scan Upload & Analysis: A simple interface to upload patient details and a corresponding CT scan image.AI-Powered Prediction: The backend processes the image through a sophisticated pipeline involving filtering, segmentation, and a VGG16-based deep learning model to classify the scan into one of four categories:AdenocarcinomaLarge Cell CarcinomaSquamous Cell CarcinomaNormal (Healthy)Detailed Results Page: Displays the prediction, confidence score, and the processed images (original, filtered, segmented).Downloadable PDF Reports: Users can download a professional PDF report for each diagnosis, which includes patient details, results, and all associated images.Organized Patient History:A main history page lists all patients associated with the user's account.Clicking on a patient shows a detailed, chronological view of all their past scans and results.Interactive & Professional UI: The entire application is designed with a modern, clean, and responsive user interface for a professional, industry-level feel.Contact Form: An integrated contact form that sends inquiries directly to the administrator's email.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackBackend:Framework: FlaskDatabase: MongoDB (with PyMongo)Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learnImage Processing: OpenCV, SciPyFrontend:Templating: Jinja2Styling: Bootstrap 5, Custom CSSJavaScript: For client-side validation and interactivityDeployment & Others:PDF Generation: PyfpdfEmail Service: Flask-Mail (with Gmail SMTP)üìã PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:Python (3.8 or newer)pip (Python package installer)MongoDB Community Serverüìß ContactCreated by Jiten Koundinye & Yash Atre - feel free to reach out!Jiten Koundinye: koundinyejiten@gmail.comYash Atre: atreyash10@gmail.comThis README was last updated on July 18, 2025.
